I managed to read **108** books, that's **44 more books** than last year. I read a lot of “fun” books and didn't take my reading habit too seriously. I'm not *on* Booktok, but I definitely could compete there... if it was a competition (it's not). 

# Here are some standouts:

1. Assistant to the Villain and Apprentice to the Villain, Hannah Nicole Maehrer - very ridiculous
2. Nettle & Bone, T. Kingfisher - love a quest tbh
3. The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo - looks great on the shelf, too
4. The Games Gods Play, Abigail Owen - some fun action
