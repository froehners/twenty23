**This case study is still a WIP**

# Background
## How Capitalize Works (at the time)
Capitalize offers free rollovers and earns a commission from financial instituions. Capitalize only receives comission from partnered financial instituions. Capitalize will move money to any institution, but prefers if user select their partners.

## Current State
- Previous tests did not improve selection rate and had a negative impact on conversion 
- Stakeholders wanted a page with all institutions grouped in categories.

## Goals & Requirements
- Increase monetized rollovers
- Reduce Drop-off
- Don’t negatively impact overall conversion

# Process
1. Question Assumptions
2. Reduce Choices
	1. Jam Study ([The Paradox of Choice](https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/paradox-of-choice)) - If we reduce the number of choices a user has to make on this page, we will see higher conversion
	2. Grouping for slight comparison of types - Behavior design class
3. UserTesting
	1. “See Fidelity, pick Fidelity”
	2. Quick choices
4. A/B Testing

# Outcomes
- **350%+** increase in preferred partner selection (!!!)
- No decrease in user experience or product satisfaction (no increase in customer complaints, survey and NPS responses did not change)
## Next Steps
This was a great solution when we had only a few partners. As we partnered with more IRA companies, we needed a way to scale this concept (this case study is on the way next!)
