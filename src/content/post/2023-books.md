I managed to read 64 books this year and my pace definitely increased after buying a new Kindle for Prime day. Overall, I read a lot of “fun” books and a few non-fiction, too. I even accidentally read my first romance book? And then a few more not accidentally???

# Here are some standouts

## Still on my desk to reference at work:
1. [Design for Cognitive Bias](https://abookapart.com/products/design-for-cognitive-bias) - Tough conversations are a little easier when you can use the fancy jargon. Sorry!!!!
	1. Also, I used Red Team, Blue Team (one of the techniques suggested to combat bias) in a workshop and my CEO emailed me after to say it was a “really great, intellectually honest process,” so 
2. [Copywrong to Copywriter](http://copygui.de) - I have to write copy sometimes and it can be tough or uncomfortable. This helps get me unstuck and more confident.

## Audiobook recommendations:
1. [Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again](https://stolenfocusbook.com/) - Johann Hari does such a great job narrating his book, it’s so warm-hearted and engaging. 
2. [How to be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Be-Perfect/Michael-Schur/9781982159320) - Amazing assist from the cast of The Good Place. The little dings for the asides had me Pavlovian trained to laugh.

## Kindle Unlimited recommendations:
1. [The Ninth House](https://www.amazon.com/Ninth-House-Leigh-Bardugo-ebook/dp/B07LF64DZ2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2R6WRTNFKKUQQ&keywords=the+ninth+house&qid=1701990415&s=digital-text&sprefix=The+ninth%2Cdigital-text%2C167&sr=1-1)
	1. I really enjoyed the sequel, Hellbent, too!
2. [The Song of Achilles](https://www.amazon.com/Song-Achilles-Enhanced-Novel-ebook/dp/B00723IP9Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=SWLGRDUPU4QI&keywords=song+of+achilles&qid=1701990351&s=digital-text&sprefix=Song+of+ac%2Cdigital-text%2C193&sr=1-1)
3. [Olga Dies Dreaming ](https://www.amazon.com/Olga-Dies-Dreaming-Xochitl-Gonzalez-ebook/dp/B0927CZS7N/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
